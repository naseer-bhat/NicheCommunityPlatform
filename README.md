# Threadify Web App

## Introduction
Threadify is a social web app built using **Vite** and **React**, designed to let users log in, read articles based on their preferred topics, and interact by posting threads, liking, commenting, and connecting with other users. The app offers a smooth and dynamic user experience for discovering and sharing content.

### Key Features:
- **User Login/Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Article Feed**: Users can view articles based on topics they are interested in.
- **Post Threads**: Users can create threads to share thoughts and discussions.
- **Like and Comment**: Interact with threads and posts through likes and comments.
- **User Connections**: Users can connect with each other and engage in conversations.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login system with JWT-based authentication.
- **Article Feed**: A dynamic feed that displays articles based on user-selected topics.
- **Thread Creation**: Users can create new threads to discuss a variety of topics.
- **Likes and Comments**: Ability for users to like and comment on threads.
- **User Connections**: Users can connect with others, view profiles, and follow their posts.

## Design Decisions or Assumptions
- **Responsive Design**: The frontend is built with responsiveness in mind, ensuring the app works on all screen sizes.
- **JWT Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate users, providing a secure, stateless session.
- **MongoDB for Storage**: MongoDB is used to store user data, articles, threads, comments, and likes.
- **Component-Based UI**: The frontend uses React's component-based architecture for easy maintainability and reusability.

## Installation & Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB Atlas account (if using a remote database)

### Steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/threadify.git
    cd threadify
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    For the **frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    For the **backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory for the following environment variables:
        ```
        MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
        ```
    
4. **Run the Backend**:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

    The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port you've set).

5. **Run the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once both the frontend and backend are running:

1. Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Sign up or log in to start browsing articles.
3. Post threads, like, comment, and connect with other users.

Example for interacting with the app:
- On the homepage, you can filter articles based on topics.
- You can post a new thread by navigating to the **Create Thread** page.

## Credentials
For testing purposes, use the following credentials:
- **Username**: `testuser`
- **Password**: `password123`

## APIs Used
- **MongoDB Atlas**: To store user, thread, and article data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Used for secure login and session management.
