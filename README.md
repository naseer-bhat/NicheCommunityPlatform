- **MongoDB for Storage**: MongoDB is used to store user data, articles, threads, comments, and likes.
- **Component-Based UI**: The frontend uses React's component-based architecture for easy maintainability and reusability.

## Installation & Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites:
- Node.js installed on your machine
- MongoDB Atlas account (if using a remote database)

### Steps to get started:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git https://github.com/naseer-bhat/NicheCommunityPlatform
    cd NicheCommunityPlatform
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    For the **frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    ```

    For the **backend**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in the **backend** directory for the following environment variables:
        ```
        PORT = 3000
        db_url="mongodb+srv://naseer:mongo2024@cluster1.5jvgt.mongodb.net/"
        SECRET_KEY="masaischoolproject"
        ```
    
4. **Run the Backend**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend should now be running on `http://localhost:5000` (or whichever port you've set).

5. **Run the Frontend**:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```

    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage
Once both the frontend and backend are running:

1. Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Sign up or log in to start browsing articles.
3. Post threads, like, comment, and connect with other users.

Example for interacting with the app:
- On the homepage, you can filter articles based on topics.
- You can post a new thread by navigating to the **Create Thread** page.

## Credentials
For testing purposes, use the following credentials:
- **Username**: `pranav@gmail.com`
- **Password**: `12345678`

## APIs Used
- **MongoDB Atlas**: To store user, thread, and article data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Used for secure login and session management.

## API Endpoints

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**:
